# BUAS Template Engine

A template game engine designed specifically for use with BUAS (Breda's University of Applied Sciences) CMGT program projects. This engine provides a flexible foundation for various game development assignments and projects.

## Overview

BUAS Template Engine is a custom game engine built with OpenGL as its rendering framework. It's designed to serve as a template engine, allowing for easy adaptation and utilization across different projects within the CMGT curriculum at BUAS.

## Features

- OpenGL-based rendering system
- Template-based architecture for flexible project adaptation
- Built specifically for CMGT coursework requirements
- Easy-to-integrate structure for various game development projects

## Prerequisites

- Modern C++ compiler (C++17 support required)
- OpenGL
- CMake build system

## Building the Project

This project uses CMake as its build system. To build the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a build directory: 
```bash
mkdir build cd build
```
3. Generate build files: 
```bash
   cmake --build
```

## Usage

The engine is designed to be used as a template for various BUAS CMGT projects. You can:
- Use it as a starting point for new game projects
- Extend the functionality as needed for specific course requirements
- Modify the rendering pipeline to suit your project needs

## Project Structure

The engine is organized to maintain a clear separation of concerns:
- `src/` - Source files
- `include/` - Header files
- `resources/` - Engine resources
- `examples/` - Example implementations

## Contributing

This is a personal project primarily designed for use in BUAS CMGT coursework. However, suggestions and improvements are welcome through issues and pull requests.
